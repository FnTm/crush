# Code Review Helper

A simple tool to assist with code review.

## Usage

The most basic use will run the tool on a directory of code.

`crush examine --directory /your/code/here`

## Installation

`go get github.com/jemurai/crush`

## Setting Expectations

We do a fair amount of code review.  As we do that, some things present
that are worthy of review pretty much whenever we see them.  They are
_candidate_ issues.  The certainty for any given item may be low, but we
put them into this tool because we want to review them.
